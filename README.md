# pokedex
Gottta catch 'em all 

What I leared form this project: 
  Displaying nested information from an external API in differnet locations (ie pictures for each pokemon on main page out of each pokemons object)
  Praticed Using Angular JS 

To-Do/Future Features:
  Fliter Pokemon by type, region etc. 
  Add regional Pokedexes 
  Multiple pages to increase loading speed.
